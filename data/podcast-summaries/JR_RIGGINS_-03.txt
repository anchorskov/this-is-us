causes and problems you know what people say that but i think people should uh read a little bit of
read a little bit of more history a little more personal history look at look at the feud between
jefferson and adams oh yeah look at the feud between hamilton and burr it doesn't get any
worse than that one right right so well i mean we've always had these things there's a factionalism
if you read i see that but but i i also see you know some some recent trends in violence and and
you know and that's to me that's where it gets out of hand where we let the the rhetoric is fine for
the folks up to a point up to a point when when you start seeing i i watched a documentary the other day
and he showed showed the speaker of the house of of arizona after the 2026 um or not 2026 i'm sorry
the 2020 election he was getting visits from folks out in front of his house where this was a pbs thing
and they showed folks you know threatening him his him threatening his children and then i recently
saw something with marjorie taylor green and i saw people threatening her when i saw them but
you know she was complaining about that her her children were getting threatened you know because
of the stance that she a political stance that she's taken and i'm thinking that's not really
political division there that's that's to me there's a line that's being crossed or what would
you say about something like that and how do we bring that that that conversation back to a more
normal is it possible to bring it back to a more normal tone there's one i think there's probably
one simple solution if most of that is on social media require your real name on every social media
post you have to no more no more anonymity no no anonymous stuff you know i also would that what
would that do it just in general i mean yeah people know who you are and you're not uh hiding behind
is this a state thing is there is something we can do at the state level or is this more of a federal
thing do you think it might be more of a social media ownership thing right well we can we can go
find the mark zuckerbergs and elon musk and we can we can tag them and you know you might get a blue
check mark if you put your real name right yeah or you you might uh you're you know and and they
they did some they tried but then they got in trouble if i remember correctly during during that
that time frame there was uh some freedom of speech blah blah blah this blah but i think that
you know any solutions in the jr riggins world for something like this well number one i think uh
i never read any of that i don't pay attention to i mean if somebody was saying anything i wouldn't
even know it right now what happens is your wives read all that stuff and they pay attention or my
children yeah but i think if you're um you never nobody's ever going to be happy with even
no i don't know what would be what how much are you how many people you're making happy on it
with a piece of legislation somebody's always disappointed because legislation is meant to
do only a couple things take authority from one person give it to someone else okay take money
from one person give it to something else so that's it's two primary goals or i should say
results is taking someone else's money doing something with it taking somebody else's authority
and doing something with it and and somebody's always going to be impacted negatively generally
speaking right so uh but i think but i think there's always been the only reason i think we hear
about uh all threats or that elevated complaining there's always been complaining about public policy
and people who make that policy but it's never been so easily found on a x post on a facebook post
never in history what you you see it in i used to write letters to the editor and you would see those complaints
or and nobody nobody really writes letters to editor to say how happy they are right they usually write
letters to enter to see how disappointed they are what's wrong with these how many times it's just
that's a great job and this and this on a post is uh that's probably one for every 25 negative ones
because negative ones just gives people an avenue to vent right so um i think if you're doing this
make sure you're paying attention to the legislation and you make sure we know what the consequences are
you know like we what we've been seeing here recently all that we've had discussions about all the property
tax stuff and the impacts it has to some uh what is fairness in taxation what is fairness in property tax
uh you know property tax is probably the oldest tax in the world either property tax is being taxed
directly or it's a sign that you have the ability to pay some actual hard-earned coin tax that
in the 17th century or the 16th century right rather than that poor guy only has five chickens
you go over there and steal one of his chickens you know that's all he has but if you have property
and feudalism days in medieval days you know it's just a sign that you have something to give the
king if you have to right right well it was back in those days that nobody owned any property so
you had to pay rent yeah you hung on you're right if you didn't the king owned it if you didn't pay your
rent to your to your lord yeah who was acting in the king's name you know then uh the lord moved you
along but they but the king took it from them too right he would get his his chunk from the lord but
anyway we don't have kind of we don't have that system anymore but and thank god we don't we have
the you know we have kind of represent ourselves you know and we have our responsibilities to keep the
system going um you know and we've kind of entered an interesting time for me and i really don't have
the answers to the division that we see that the the real divisive stuff that that creates those
those threats and and those though that i think that's when you a bridge too far maybe as a line
has been crossed in my mind and you know how do we legislate that line because there should probably
be some some some consequences for folks that cross a line and you know defining that line
is going to be an interesting challenge but and and i was just picking your mind on you know because i
think we can do something on the state level i think the state could could draw a line also well they have
you know just even rules in uh in our debate you know because people get fired up at one another
sure in the state legislature you know like we we go the extra mile on the on the on that you know
there's been a few times people have to kind of publicly apologize for something they say
right right on the chambers and stuff but by and large i don't uh i don't hear i have my first
year so i never really heard too much of that right and then and uh if people who don't know i missed
four weeks of it surgery right so unexpected surgery for it but so uh but they do go out of way at that
level now you don't see it in congress so much u.s congress right right i think they could be a
little harder on those people yeah about how they behave to one another and even though they have
rules on it they tend to pretty much accuse you of anything they want to you on that on
seems like it doesn't it at that level because and they probably have already done always done that
you know maybe but how would you know because those conversations aren't nobody was listening
to those conversations 24 7 for the first 200 years right but now there's always somebody out
there ready with a send a quip or a quote or something on facebook media any type of social
post that you would never have heard uh even 20 years ago it wouldn't it didn't exist so even if
they were all mad at one another you really wouldn't know it right right and i think that's
probably that's probably why we see it more we feel there's more of it now because of that
just the exposure uh an out of context statement is made and do you think that a conversations with
with you know like the one we're having right here where we got to sit down and look each other
in the eye do you think that might help bring that that that tone down and bring us back away from
that line that i was talking about well it did now if we're talking at like a legislative level
but here when you're talking about just uh random acts of uh bad behavior and conversation on
internet i mean what what is the subject that they're mad about what is the policy they're mad about
i think whatever you know that led that leads to that that that vitriol right they we got to tone
it down from what i have learned from my experience when they want uh my side to tone it down is because
they don't want to talk about the policy whatever it is and whatever policy but when you say i i kind
of kind of have a rule on the this is us podcast and that's we don't get to say they and them
this we always got to define it if you're talking about they being your your political opponents and
we just could be yeah it could be a political opponent or because it's hard for me to understand
when when we talk about and i see that in conversations somebody says they i'm like okay
who are you talking about when you say they yeah because a lot of times it's it it's actually us
you know because we actually i from my point of view as a citizen we're the ones that elect our
representatives yes i'm and i think i've when i use that phrase i'm thinking the anonymous posters
the anonymous all your social media and so when we don't even know who they are right if we don't
have a name and we can't put our fingers on them yeah then they shouldn't be i think that i've heard
it i've heard it mentioned a few times i think i see things on my my facebook feed occasionally where
it appears and you're like you don't really know if this is a real person or if it's a bot or if it's
you know some foreign actor we don't we don't know and you know is is that a line too far should
we should we should we ask mark zuckerberg to to stop people that we don't know from from on our
our facebook feeds would that be fair would that be a violation of free speech probably lower your
feed numbers your viewing numbers that'd be okay with me and there's some stuff that i mean and he
he does allow us to like you know you can click on something and say i don't want to see any more
of this and then that that's that's good i like they were taking some liberties here just not too
long ago and just getting rid of it themselves yeah not without your consent uh so i'm still that's
still in the background that that that is kind of an issue you know so if i don't want to see it
that should be my choice i suppose maybe that's that's the key right there and you know instead
of trying to legislate something like that you just accept the responsibility yourself you know
and if it's if you find something that crosses your line then don't don't be if you're if you run
for office and you know this is state level this isn't federal or something you just simply have
an obligation uh to be decent to be polite i mean even if you're mad about it and uh then i haven't
encountered that i have heard stories uh you know legislative stories and i couldn't even tell you
what the subjects are but you know everybody i'm uh there's no one i don't enjoy visiting with down
with the legislature i mean you can't visit with and there's 60 of it or but i will be on i don't
only know i only met a few i only know a few senators i didn't even walk over to that side of the house
except the first day to see where it was so we're represented by bob i'd have you had a conversation
yeah i know bob i'd the local senator is different drew perkins gruesome i've always liked drew uh
drew is the lieutenant governor right man no he's he's the chief of staff he's chief of staff okay
we don't have lieutenant governor we have chief of staff right so but i met uh just not too long ago
i ran into one of the senators and i had to kind of think i know he's a senator i have no idea who he is
because we literally you're so right you're so preoccupied you don't even make it across the other
side of the capitol and stop by the senate and say hello right and they're busy everybody the time is
the is the most precious commodity you have in the legislature because of how many limited days you
have to do what it works and the deadlines you have the whole process and it's pretty fascinating
actually and and uh i'm impressed by the people who are so experienced at it that it comes natural to
and uh it's certainly not going to you're not going to be a natural at that in a year and i think
i'll be honest with you they think that i don't think you're going to be an expert at that process and
and you're going to be a much better if you were in your third or third or fourth year you'd be way
more comfortable now uh i've been happy with the bills i've written at least i try to be very concise
on my bills i don't just put out a statement ask the lso to draft it up i have a very specific thing
i want to do with a piece of legislation i cross out this section put that comma in send it all like
that highlight it underline it and in red and cross out in blue and and uh so that the lso office doesn't
have to do any more work than than necessary and uh and i'm surprised sometimes i did uh ask somebody about
legislation once and i thought what that whole paragraph gets rid of these 17 paragraphs why
wouldn't they just do that well because lso is only so many people during that session and they
i'll be honest with you this is like 40 days of what if you have christmas going on here get all the
all the retailers right that's their their big everybody's working hard on selling stuff over
the christmas season here right now well that's what it's like in uh the session for lso that's
their christmas non-stop work 24 hours a day session for for a month so you're you're you're sending a
shout out to the folks in the lso office at the state no i've been impressed i mean they're impressing
you that's good we've got a good product then you said that was established in 1971
yeah and they they've had a time some time to grow and and provide a service to the to the
legislature and the folks in the state that's your staff you know and uh just we don't have our own
staff so we rely on them for the tech some technical expertise certainly department of revenue and the
mathematics and and you've just been watching the budget stuff yeah i uh i was just just uh messing
around on the lso or the ledge of the state it's it's it's wild ledge.gov or somewhere yeah something
like that and anyway i was there i noticed that you can you can get a copy of current legislation
pending legislation where the legislation's at a lot of information that's available to the public
there if you you want to go and take a look at it and you have a whole you have another it staff
through lso that's doing all that yeah posting all that keeping it up to date uh plus your
attorneys you know and you know what they're just they're uh uh you can drop in on them you know
in wyoming it's probably one of the it is the uh i'll bet it's the most unique capital and uh
relationship between elected officials and people come down to cheyenne so you don't walk in the door
right you don't have your a personal staff member do you know this is your the lso is your staff is
that that's how it works in wyoming do your own research you know i mean you rely on other
people might have some expertise in the field you know uh it could be anybody there's sometimes
their national stuff but you got to remember there's legislation all across the country that's
similar right not just wyoming i mean every if you're in a western state come having to deal with
public lands there's something going on in those states as well at the state level so yeah i want to
skip over a couple things i i know you're you you never did answer my question about the freedom
caucus and i i think we can probably skip that one we'll look at your voting record to determine
how you fall there and and keep that you know between you and and me and the constituency and
well i guess you never know where they publish that yeah yeah they you know and and and the person
the people that want to know wild file or cowboy state daily or wherever that that well they're
gonna put you wherever they want to put you you're gonna you're gonna end up there and there's nothing
you can do about that so let's let's move on to one of my favorite topics and that's money i we were
talking about um how wyoming's you know i i look at wyoming as conservative state and what that means
to me is that we don't squander money and it you know folks are like we uh we're all concerned about
property taxes and backfilling this and that and funding our schools tell us a little bit about how
the one how the state did with its uh with its investments last year well they they killed it
like everybody else well i won't know if everybody else but certainly they had i think they had record
breaking return on their their permanent minerals trust fund uh was it it was a close to a billion
dollars close to a billion dollars so if you go look at i guarantee you go to lso and department
revenue you're going to see some charts of grass you're going to see this one for the uh pmt
way way up right here at the end now is that an excuse to be able to go out and spend a bunch
more money on things that you would just love to have uh to me it's not i'm uh most conservatives
that's not i mean once we we we i think for me personally i like i'd like to leave some leaves
leave our state at a better position financially than we isn't you know if compare ourselves to
other states for a population this small i mean uh the government's pretty
also maybe resourceful is not to quite word number one you know we're required to have a balanced budget
so we can't get the deficit that that's more than some states can say right uh we benefit from an
economy and the minerals and oil and gas that other states have those very same things but
uh i don't think it benefits them as much as as it does our states those minerals and stuff
um and you come to rely on those things right and we haven't seen a big decline in that particular
area well the biggest one was the 1980s when i was
out here and and nobody you know and if you didn't live here at the time you don't you
you you can't even imagine how quickly it went backwards how many houses went to foreclosure
uh you know some of the places in michigan you've heard about like florida a number of years ago had
a big collapse in the housing market michigan over the years different times in their history
had big collapses not like this they we had 60 to 70 percent losses in your in your real estate
sounds like a warning yeah you're saying that that history shows us that it's not all
it can happen good times but but i think um the forces that created that anomaly i don't know if
they really exist now because of the the much larger global scale of energy trading and right it
certainly there have a right now it's a bit of a decline right yeah but in return because they have
such a when energy is low manufacturing prospers in a sense right energy is cheaper it helps them
right and somebody and we're invested in that kind of stuff in the in the permanent all of our
different investment funds we got it we got about about five minutes left here for this hour um
and is there anything you'd like to slip in here right at the end well let the so this be my first
budget session and to me it's already a slight improvement i think it's a little bit less than
last time i i thought last year's but maybe it wasn't but it's what the governor had is 11.1
billion dollars is what his recommended budget is i watched it and i i didn't i didn't record any of
the numbers are kind of going fast real fast because there's so much stuff going on uh in the
that is one of the the uh podcasts the on youtube lso the uh the lso office published that so you can
actually watch the whole budget episode when when when governor gordon goes in and and presents his
budget to the to the legislature right i thought it was worth listening to so if you haven't i mean
go to youtube and look for look for that that episode yeah it's on youtube and it's uh unedited and
people remind you when you're in the chambers uh turn off your speaker because people in ireland can
hear you and then uh also when you're in the back always stand back if you ever see pictures of the
house because the cameras go where the microphone is on it hits all four corners i see and so you get
don't be over there picking your nose at the wrong time you'll be on youtube but you're immortalized
i'll close with this on the budget uh of course everybody uh there was an article just yesterday
about the university of wyoming wanting i know they wanted another 40 some million dollars but
you know what one deal was three three million dollars for nil stuff right the college sports
no i'll say uh i don't i don't think it's a positive outcome what it's become of of uh college
football right that's is it is it semi-pro is that what it's going to be now oh they're gonna you mean
they're gonna start paying the players they're already paying they're already paying the players is
that right oh yeah it's you know i i really haven't put much thought behind that is that is that an
issue for for you well it's it's only an issue because now if you want to be competitive at the
ncaa level uh now you have you have to be part of that whole uh formula really so we we have to go
out there and and use money to recruit football players now and i'm gonna get i'm in the short i'll
say yeah that must be i don't know how is it i don't don't know the the particulars of is it direct
payments is it so if we ever happen to find another josh allen in wyoming we're gonna have to
like cough up some serious cash to keep him my guess if you find another josh allen wyoming if
somebody recognizes it in the first year you're not going to be able to afford to keep him in wyoming
that's that is a kind of a concern is that a state issue or is that a federal issue you know
well it's clear across college football everywhere you know so it sounds like it's an interstate issue
national issue and it's it's got period people from uh national sports broadcasters aggravated
about it and and now and now to me it's a little bit out of control i mean how are you gonna
rein that in right and what about what about the students who are just there to learn right go to
college you know and what about the football players that are there to go to college and they
they just get so yeah there's only there's only one out of a hundred of them are gonna go to the
to play football again after that and so if we start focusing that you know i i yeah i mean i've been
i've been a season ticket holder for decades i've been to hundreds of hundreds of football games
and uh now we got to worry about our best players getting sucked up well it and it's always been
it's not exactly always we kind of had to find that lucky nugget right right that was how it's
always been yeah i think so but now everybody's on tv everybody can be a talent can be spotted pretty
quickly and everybody's pirating everybody others player you know right so how long can a
uh wyoming or if you look at uw's budget i'm just gonna say it's three four hundred million
whatever it is it's a big number right right and is that gonna how big does that number have to get
before it's too big to to fund right or what are you gonna have to say no you're not gonna build that
not if you're gonna have a good team and basketball or whatever it is at any level and it seems like you
know you know i don't want to take anything away from the the the student athletes or anything like
that but at the same time i i think some common sense might weigh in here some limits on you know
the compensation that we could do and and if we're going to compensate when i was in school that was
that was just a forbidden thing you know you didn't do that in at this level and now it sounds
like that we have started it yeah if you if you cats out of the bag so to speak intimately uh i mean i
haven't dove into super deep but i am pretty sure there's players in the sec and in different
places they're making a million a season yeah that's as a as a as a college kid huh yeah well
you better teach some financial literacy while you're at that well hopefully they're taking that
class uh jr i think we we have kind of run out of time and that's an interesting topic maybe
something for the future to to delve into a little bit but thanks for for showing up for the
this is us podcast it is you know i think this is the second episode that i've i've talked about i
had one earlier last year well this is my first ever so so thanks a lot master it late master it
later maybe right and thanks you know now you got something to listen to as you go down the road
yeah i'll get this there's my wife yeah i'll get this up on spotify and uh um and we'll see how we do
all right
you
all right
all right
