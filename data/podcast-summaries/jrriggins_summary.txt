TRANSCRIPT OVERVIEW:
--------------------

Hello, this is Jim Skogard with This Is Us podcast. My guest today is J.R. Riggins from House District 59, State of Wyoming. How are you today, J.R.?
I'm doing well, Jim. Thanks for the invitation and looking forward to how this all turns out.
Hey, J.R., you know, me, I grew up in Grable Basin and I understand you grew up here in Casper?
Actually, I'm a South Dakotan born, but I worked out here from the age of 15 over in Cody and until today.
So I've been here as long as most people, except for 15 years, the age of 15 before that, I was mostly staying at home in South Dakota.
Gotcha. J.R., you just started with the house in January 2025, is that correct?
Yep. Elected here in the November election in the 24.
In 24? Oh, so you were elected in the 24 election and you got sworn in in January.
And what have been the challenges, do you think, so far?
Was it a steep learning curve to figure out how to interact in the house?
You know, I'm not completely, I'm not a novice to things like Robert's Rules from being involved in county politics and committee meetings.
I was on the state committee for three years, but they use a different set of rules there.
The biggest thing to get adjusted to is because there's 60-some people in there, so you don't trample over one another.
Very specific ways to communicate on the floor.
Lots of integration with other departments, the legislative service office, the membership, the whole process from getting a bill introduced to getting it passed.
In a short time frame, in a hurry.
I see.
Did anything ever get done in a hurry, do you think?
Well, we had a big goal of running, we had the five and dime plan.
I think that was five bills passed in 10 days.

TRANSCRIPT OVERVIEW:
--------------------

Well, we were talking about power, and might as well just keep talking about power.
We got some data centers coming into the state of Wyoming, one being built in Cheyenne.
I heard a proposal about one built between here and Casper and Glenrock, halfway between or something like that.
It's going to be powered by natural gas.
Tallgrass is a partner, the one in Cheyenne, right?
They're providing the gas from their collection network.
What can you tell me about those things?
Full disclosure, I used to work for that company and retired here in July for Tallgrass Energy.
Yeah, they're going to provide gas-powered turbines in Cheyenne,
and I believe that's directly just for the purpose of the data centers there in that location.
I don't know if it's just for the one.
I'm just going to assume it's for one particular company.
It had a pretty big, I don't know, in the gigawatt range.
And, yeah, there is discussions going on here just to our east out of town between here and Glenrock about a proposal to put a data center.
I think it might be a little bit different style.
It's not like Google's planting something there.
I think there's a developing trend where companies are putting the infrastructure together where they have the building and they have the power and they have a method for the cooling system, in a sense, for the actual processing.
But then rent out the whole entity.
All that, one of the big discussions in legislation has been the exemptions for sales tax or just elements of it, right?
Not really for the construction.

causes and problems you know what people say that but i think people should uh read a little bit of
read a little bit of more history a little more personal history look at look at the feud between
jefferson and adams oh yeah look at the feud between hamilton and burr it doesn't get any
worse than that one right right so well i mean we've always had these things there's a factionalism
if you read i see that but but i i also see you know some some recent trends in violence and and
you know and that's to me that's where it gets out of hand where we let the the rhetoric is fine for
the folks up to a point up to a point when when you start seeing i i watched a documentary the other day
and he showed showed the speaker of the house of of arizona after the 2026 um or not 2026 i'm sorry
the 2020 election he was getting visits from folks out in front of his house where this was a pbs thing
and they showed folks you know threatening him his him threatening his children and then i recently
saw something with marjorie taylor green and i saw people threatening her when i saw them but
you know she was complaining about that her her children were getting threatened you know because
of the stance that she a political stance that she's taken and i'm thinking that's not really
political division there that's that's to me there's a line that's being crossed or what would
you say about something like that and how do we bring that that that conversation back to a more
normal is it possible to bring it back to a more normal tone there's one i think there's probably
one simple solution if most of that is on social media require your real name on every social media
post you have to no more no more anonymity no no anonymous stuff you know i also would that what
would that do it just in general i mean yeah people know who you are and you're not uh hiding behind
is this a state thing is there is something we can do at the state level or is this more of a federal
