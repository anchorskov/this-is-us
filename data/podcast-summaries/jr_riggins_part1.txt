TRANSCRIPT OVERVIEW:
--------------------

Hello, this is Jim Skogard with This Is Us podcast. My guest today is J.R. Riggins from House District 59, State of Wyoming. How are you today, J.R.?
I'm doing well, Jim. Thanks for the invitation and looking forward to how this all turns out.
Hey, J.R., you know, me, I grew up in Grable Basin and I understand you grew up here in Casper?
Actually, I'm a South Dakotan born, but I worked out here from the age of 15 over in Cody and until today.
So I've been here as long as most people, except for 15 years, the age of 15 before that, I was mostly staying at home in South Dakota.
Gotcha. J.R., you just started with the house in January 2025, is that correct?
Yep. Elected here in the November election in the 24.
In 24? Oh, so you were elected in the 24 election and you got sworn in in January.
And what have been the challenges, do you think, so far?
Was it a steep learning curve to figure out how to interact in the house?
You know, I'm not completely, I'm not a novice to things like Robert's Rules from being involved in county politics and committee meetings.
I was on the state committee for three years, but they use a different set of rules there.
The biggest thing to get adjusted to is because there's 60-some people in there, so you don't trample over one another.
Very specific ways to communicate on the floor.
Lots of integration with other departments, the legislative service office, the membership, the whole process from getting a bill introduced to getting it passed.
In a short time frame, in a hurry.
I see.
Did anything ever get done in a hurry, do you think?
Well, we had a big goal of running, we had the five and dime plan.
I think that was five bills passed in 10 days.
