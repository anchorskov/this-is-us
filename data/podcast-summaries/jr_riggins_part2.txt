Well, we were talking about power, and might as well just keep talking about power.
We got some data centers coming into the state of Wyoming, one being built in Cheyenne.
I heard a proposal about one built between here and Casper and Glenrock, halfway between or something like that.

I'm just going to assume it's for one particular company.
It had a pretty big, I don't know, in the gigawatt range.
And, yeah, there is discussions going on here just to our east out of town between here and Glenrock about a proposal to put a data center.
I think it might be a little bit different style.
It's not like Google's planting something there.
I think there's a developing trend where companies are putting the infrastructure together where they have the building and they have the power and they have a method for the cooling system, in a sense, for the actual processing.
But then rent out the whole entity.

Not really for the construction.
