00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Hello, everybody. This is Jim Skogard. I'm here with the very first inaugural episode of this is off

00:06.400 --> 00:14.600
So I'm here with Deacon Taylor out at Denver, Colorado at the Central Wyoming Farron rodeo. Welcome to the show folks. Hi, Deacon

00:14.600 --> 00:21.740
Hi Jim. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here. We can it's a pleasure to have you. I've been following you quite a

00:21.740 --> 00:30.940
bit on Facebook and I kind of admire your your spunk and ambition. What what exactly are you up to? Well, so my lack of filters what you're probably

00:30.940 --> 00:42.380
referring to. Yeah, a little bit maybe. Yeah, so what I'm up to is I've started an organization that we're loosely calling citizens United and our main focus is after the

00:42.380 --> 00:51.620
Citizens United ruling that happened in 2010. Politics has just been inundated and flooded with money and I'm not okay with that. And I think most

00:51.620 --> 01:04.460
people are not okay with that. Right. And when you say inundated with money, where where's that money coming from? Do you think? So lobbying groups, corporations and billionaires are all just basically buying our

01:04.460 --> 01:16.660
elections and buying our politicians. And when you say buying our elections, how does somebody buy a boat? You know, I'm looking at like, no, I've never gotten any money. They're not

01:16.660 --> 01:27.180
sending me a check. How does one buy an election? Well, we saw it with Elon Musk when he tried to go into Michigan and buy the court boat that they had going on up there. They just

01:27.180 --> 01:39.580
flood the money with marketing and campaigns and propaganda in order to try to persuade the voters to vote the way they want. So if you have a propaganda, you said

01:39.580 --> 02:09.580
propaganda, is that like a message that gets repeated over and over again? Can I have explained that a little bit? So propaganda from my perspective is a weaponized information system. Being former military, I know you were former National Guard as well. Taking a political message and rebranding it and refocusing it to accomplish an objective. That's propaganda. Is it, is it true? Sometimes there's threads of truth in it. Other times, it's completely made up. Completely made up. Have you,

02:09.580 --> 02:39.500
run across a specific example that you, that comes to mind her? In current events, I'm watching the mayoral race in New York, and I'm seeing where they're labeling this guy in all kinds of ways that are not actually true. Oh, you bring up the word label. How to, you know, I was, I've done a little bit of writing on labeling and things like that. I don't know, maybe you can read something from my, one of my posters about labeling and how we, we kind of define that. So you got to point me in the right direction.

02:39.580 --> 02:52.860
There's a lot of information here. So confirmation bias, we seek out information that agrees with us, the, the tribal cues, how we try to stay in line with the group that we align with.

02:53.460 --> 03:03.380
Are any of those resonating with you? Do you see these in action ever? I see them in action a lot, especially in modern ideology or identity politics, rather.

03:04.260 --> 03:11.380
People get so ingrained with this idea of tribalism that they can't seem to break away from it. Tribalism, that's kind of a good term. What does that mean?

03:12.500 --> 03:22.980
From my perspective, it's, we all came from hunter gatherer tribes and fairly small groups moving throughout history. As far back as we can find in our, our evolutionary path.

03:23.940 --> 03:31.700
In that process, you have a collective that you are safer being a part of than if you are ostracized or kicked out of.

03:31.700 --> 03:36.980
And so people are very in tune with the idea of being in the group rather than out of a group.

03:36.980 --> 03:45.540
So kind of an instinctual type of a development in our evolution perhaps. Very much instinctual. Like built in, nothing we can do about it, right?

03:45.540 --> 03:56.740
Well, I mean, through our, our brain, we can actually process through things and evolve past that natural response, but it is very much ingrained in the, the baking of our DNA.

03:56.740 --> 04:03.380
I see. And is actually pausing and thinking about something is that easy to do?

04:04.180 --> 04:10.660
It's not for most people. Taking that breath is not something that we're really trained to do in our society.

04:11.220 --> 04:23.460
How long do you think you should consider a divisive issue that you feel strongly about? If something wants to trigger you, how long should you pause before you respond, do you think?

04:24.340 --> 04:33.540
I don't think there's a definite time frame per se, but the more triggered you are, the longer you should probably evaluate what's going on before you have a response.

04:33.540 --> 04:39.380
I see. But most people's instinct is to label and dismiss. Would you say that's correct?

04:39.380 --> 04:51.780
100%. So if we label and dismiss, how do we ever think about the divisive subject that's in front of us? How do we, how do we bridge that?

04:51.860 --> 04:54.260
That's something that people don't typically do.

04:55.220 --> 04:59.940
But if we were to, to try to get someone to consider that, how would we go about doing that?

05:00.580 --> 05:06.500
What can, what's the message we get sent to the listener? What can I do? Suppose you have your, it's your family.

05:06.500 --> 05:18.420
And suppose you, you're not going to disown your sister or your brother, and yet they're, they're triggering when, when, whenever you bring up a divisive topic, how do we, how do we get past that?

05:19.220 --> 05:27.460
That's a really good question. I don't necessarily know how we solve that problem. I think you're more able to talk about that subject than I am.

05:27.460 --> 05:36.900
But what I can see in our identity politics is there are family members that are absolutely ostracizing each other over the current administration alone.

05:36.980 --> 05:46.020
Right? And I, you know, I bring this up because I've been labeled a rhino by my brother. And I'm like, really, you know, this is my brother.

05:46.020 --> 05:55.220
How do I become a rhino to my, to someone in my, my immediate family, just because I espouse conservative Republican values.

05:55.220 --> 06:04.420
I'm of this, the old school, Alan Simpson, Dick Cheney Republicans, that, that we didn't go out to, to hurt each other.

06:04.420 --> 06:18.900
We don't play the game of fear and retribution and, and tow the party line. We, we, we tried to be conservative and we tried to encourage thought and, and, and all of a sudden, we become divided as a nation.

06:18.900 --> 06:24.740
And, and is there a tool out there you think that we can use to help bridge that gap at all?

06:25.220 --> 06:36.820
I think it's more a, we're going to have to have a lot of patience with the individuals that are so baked into their identity politics because they, they're not seeing anything outside of it.

06:36.820 --> 06:53.060
And because of our technology, as you talk about a lot in your booth here, the, the internet and the AI platforms and everything, focus our content to where we only hear those repeated message and reaffirming what we actually think.

06:53.220 --> 06:56.580
We get into these little echo chambers as we call them on the internet.

06:56.580 --> 07:07.060
Echo chambers. So, what would you say if, if, is truth ever going to catch up with misinformation and lies and politics?

07:07.060 --> 07:12.500
Unfortunately, lies travel like a, like a wildfire and truth travels like a trickle.

07:12.500 --> 07:19.940
Right. I think Mark Twain had said something about it. I think he says, a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its shoes tied.

07:19.940 --> 07:24.180
I, I think that's fairly close to it. I don't, I don't know the quote exactly, but you're right.

07:24.180 --> 07:31.540
I think, I think that's pretty close. And you know, I, I've seen, I've seen it, I've seen the, the switches we've talked about labels a little earlier.

07:31.540 --> 07:39.940
And I've, I've actually seen that here at the, at the Central Womming Fair in rodeo where we're talking and in a, a switch flips and somebody and they say,

07:39.940 --> 07:52.660
oh, you're a rhino. And I'm like, what does that mean? I, I, I, when I open my conversation, I explain that I'm a conservative Republican and I have, I spouse conservative Republican values.

07:52.660 --> 08:03.460
Yep. And if you're a Republican, that doesn't mean you're in name only. You're a Republican. You don't, and, and the idea that we can throw people out of the Republican party is, is ludicrous to me.

08:03.460 --> 08:18.980
It's like, it's an assert, absurdity. And yet we do it. Yep. And so with that kind of divisive type, I don't know, language and, and viewpoints and, and we've got to, you know, ride for the brand that's in Wyoming.

08:18.980 --> 08:28.420
You know, that comes from Owen Wisters, but you know what else comes from that same same article that I wrote. He said, your word is your bond.

08:28.420 --> 08:47.540
Is that, do that, does that fit into the same, same, uh, topic, I guess? I would think so. Um, the problem that we have in politics, at least from my perspective is, you'll have a politician that says one thing in front of one audience and then they go to a different audience and they say something entirely different.

08:47.540 --> 08:57.220
And how does that speak to character? To me, it's a lack of integrity. And I have no, no place in my world for the kind of people that have that ability to just sway from one,

08:57.220 --> 09:06.420
one position to another. I see. So integrity and character would be important to you in, in your choices as, as for a representative.

09:06.420 --> 09:17.540
Absolutely. That's one of the reasons why I got so actively involved in politics, because being former military, and I know you were former National Guard, integrity and all of those things are a sign of leadership.

09:17.540 --> 09:23.540
And if I don't have somebody that I feel like I can actually trust and follow, I'm not going to trust and follow them.

09:23.620 --> 09:29.540
Right. Well, thank you for your service, Deakin. And, you know, thank you for coming down and visiting with us.

09:29.540 --> 09:35.140
Uh, you have anything else you'd like to share with the listeners on this inaugurable broadcast.

09:35.140 --> 09:40.340
I think it's more important. Let's, let's talk about some of the things that has inspired you to run for office.

09:40.340 --> 09:43.540
Right. And got you off the couch and got you involved in politics.

09:43.540 --> 09:50.900
In September, 2024, I found myself talking to myself. And I thought, why am I talking to myself when I should be talking to other people?

09:50.900 --> 10:01.700
So I started posting online and things like that. And I went on a journey and adventure with some, some folks that I later found out to be Democrats and Washington DC, I landed in DC.

10:01.700 --> 10:10.500
They, they bought me a plane ticket. So I went and got on the bus with them. And we traveled across Pennsylvania and we traveled across Michigan.

10:10.500 --> 10:17.460
And we ended up in Detroit at the end. And, and we talked to a bunch of Democrats. And I'm like, I'm a conservative Republican.

10:17.460 --> 10:26.100
Why am I talking to Democrats? I went there to, to, you know, I thought, well, I was going to go down and see what's going on in conservative areas of the states.

10:26.100 --> 10:33.460
But now we avoided those. I was like, well, it's a little disappointed, but I got, I got a viewpoint of, of the other side.

10:33.460 --> 10:43.220
Yeah. And they're not the other side. They're us. And so I started forming the idea of creating this is us. And I know there's a TV show that's called this is us.

10:43.220 --> 11:00.580
But I'm like, it's still us. So I'm going to use this as us as my platform and try to build a community that like my individual individuals that think alike and can, can, can bypass the bias in politics.

11:00.580 --> 11:04.460
You're from Basin. So, so, did you grow up the Republican?

11:04.700 --> 11:13.580
Well, I, I didn't know what exactly a Republican was, but I definitely grew up with the Wyoming conservative personality and, and the idea of small,

11:13.580 --> 11:18.780
limited government and fiscal responsibility and all the espoused values of the Republican Party.

11:19.660 --> 11:26.220
What I have found over the years is that depending on which part of the country you're in, Republican means something entirely different.

11:26.220 --> 11:32.460
Right. So, a Republican in California is not the same as a Republican from Wyoming or Republican even from Texas.

11:33.020 --> 11:46.460
Same thing with Democrats, a Democrat in California is not the same as a Democrat in New York. They are very different cultural entities, but they all seem to fall under that same umbrella even though they're not fully aligned in what they truly believe.

11:46.460 --> 11:50.460
So, what does conservative mean to you?

11:50.460 --> 12:01.460
Well, that's an interesting topic. So, when I think of conservative, I think of people trying to hold back progress at the end of the day.

12:01.460 --> 12:13.060
And when I started to really study politics and depth, I got into studying what our founders were really about and the majority of our founders were very liberal and very progressive for their time.

12:13.060 --> 12:21.780
If you think about what this country is and what it turned into, it was the most progressive liberal document that was ever written in the history of humanity.

12:21.780 --> 12:33.780
But yet, for some reason, the conservatives that call themselves conservatives today are trying to say that that's a conservative document. It's like, no, for its time, that was more progressive than anything we'd ever seen.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.780
So, it's hard to really pin that down.

12:36.780 --> 12:41.780
It really is. And we shift the meaning of our terminology, don't we?

12:41.780 --> 12:42.780
We do.

12:42.780 --> 12:49.780
And now, to be conservative, if you need to follow exactly what the leadership is telling you to do without questioning.

12:49.780 --> 12:52.780
Certainly in the MAGA crowd, that is what they are going for.

12:52.780 --> 12:58.780
And, you know, that's the majority of folks in Wyoming who want to vote with the R.

12:58.780 --> 13:06.780
You know, if you got the R in front of your name, 72% of the population identifies as R, that's the tribe that we're looking at.

13:06.780 --> 13:12.780
And I identify as conservative, conservative R, Republican. I always have.

13:12.780 --> 13:19.780
Now, you know, and I've been, I have not voted with my tribe, and I've been labeled for that.

13:19.780 --> 13:29.780
And that is, it's unfortunate that we've come to that because the label allows us to dismiss the ideas that we should really take the time to consider.

13:29.780 --> 13:41.780
We need to pause. I've studied this a little bit. We need to pause for six seconds when we run into a divisive topic that makes us want to flip a love, flip a switch and apply a label and dismiss.

13:41.780 --> 13:46.780
We need to pause. And the time, the time frame that we need to pause is six seconds.

13:46.780 --> 13:55.780
And the reason is the time between instinct and the actual thought process on average is six seconds in an individual.

13:55.780 --> 14:04.780
So if you can, if you feel that switch, that label switch being flipped and you want to dismiss what you're hearing, I ask you to pause for six seconds.

14:04.780 --> 14:05.780
I like that.

14:05.780 --> 14:17.780
We begin, begin the process of actually engaging your brain. Did you know that the brain is occupies two percent of the body weight and consumes nearly 20% of our, our energy?

14:17.780 --> 14:18.780
That I didn't know.

14:18.780 --> 14:25.780
Yes. And so, so why do we use these, these tricks, these heuristics, these things that we were talking about earlier?

14:25.780 --> 14:36.780
We use those because it's instinctual. We have to. We are, we are limited on how much energy we can spend in our brains. And our brains are, our curious, we're curious.

14:36.780 --> 14:45.780
But when we find something that we disagree with or violates our worldview, we have labels for it. These are mechanisms of survival.

14:45.780 --> 14:53.780
And so what's happening with echo chambers you mentioned earlier, silos, you know, our news, our choice of media.

14:53.780 --> 14:59.780
We get the same messages echoed to us over and over again. And it becomes our reality.

14:59.780 --> 15:11.780
And then when we, when we react, are we, we are introduced to something that is contrary to our worldview, then we label it and we have a mechanism to just dismiss without even considering.

15:11.780 --> 15:20.780
So I'm, I'm actively encouraging folks to stop and we pause that six seconds and allow their brains to actually catch up with their instinctual reaction.

15:20.780 --> 15:21.780
Yep.

15:21.780 --> 15:31.780
And that's a hard thing to do. I've watched people here at the central warming fair in rodeo. They'll realize what I'm saying violates our worldview, that, that, that, and that switch flips.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.780
Yeah. And it's almost instant.

15:33.780 --> 15:38.780
And it is instant because that's how it had to be. When we were running from a tiger, we said tiger run.

15:38.780 --> 15:39.780
Yep.

15:39.780 --> 15:45.780
You know, now we say, oh, this is, this is not, I don't agree with this run, you know, shut off.

15:45.780 --> 15:46.780
Yeah.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.780
Don't consider because I'm going to, I'm going to have to waste some energy.

15:49.780 --> 15:52.780
Anyway, that was kind of a long-winded explanation.

15:52.780 --> 15:53.780
That's okay.

15:53.780 --> 15:54.780
I hope you don't mind.

15:54.780 --> 16:05.780
Tell me what, what, what got you out of the, out of the house today, come down here to, to support Jim Scoguard for sending in, in Casper, Wyoming.

16:05.780 --> 16:08.780
Well, the real short simple answer is I care.

16:08.780 --> 16:13.780
I care about what's happening in this country. I care about what's happening in our communities.

16:13.780 --> 16:17.780
And I'm tired of sitting back waiting for somebody else to do something.

16:17.780 --> 16:23.780
And so for the people that don't know this already, I ran for office in 2016.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.780
We started the process in 2014 with my running mate.

16:27.780 --> 16:30.780
And we actually built a third party in this country.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.780
And we did it in about two and a half to three years.

16:33.780 --> 16:34.780
And we were on the ballot.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.780
And I think it was 19 states.

16:36.780 --> 16:39.780
And then we had right in status for 25, or for a total of 25.

16:39.780 --> 16:40.780
Really?

16:40.780 --> 16:44.780
When you talk about being on the ballot, how come you couldn't get on 50 states?

16:44.780 --> 16:46.780
That's a really long conversation.

16:46.780 --> 16:50.780
But the short answer is to get on the ballot in the vast majority of states,

16:50.780 --> 16:54.780
it is an astronomical lift and an astronomical ask.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.780
In some states, it's monumental in the amount of money that it takes,

16:58.780 --> 17:02.780
because you have to literally spend $250,000.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.780
I think it was in one of the New England states.

17:05.780 --> 17:09.780
Plus, you had to collect like 600,000 signatures or something like that.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.780
Don't quote me on the exact numbers because that was over 10 years ago.

17:12.780 --> 17:15.780
And I don't remember exactly what they were.

17:15.780 --> 17:19.780
But it was unbelievable the things that were in place to prevent.

17:19.780 --> 17:26.780
Anybody that wasn't a part of the DNR program to get on the ballot and actually be electable.

17:26.780 --> 17:27.780
Really?

17:27.780 --> 17:32.780
That sounds like we could, you know, as citizens, we could probably put something together

17:32.780 --> 17:39.780
if we all joined together with a common cost to reduce those type of barriers to voices, basically.

17:39.780 --> 17:40.780
It is.

17:40.780 --> 17:44.780
And it's one of the things that I'm really passionate about is how do we fix our elections?

17:44.780 --> 17:48.780
Because right now, if you don't have a voice in the primary process,

17:48.780 --> 17:51.780
you essentially don't get a voice.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.780
Because the primaries are where the elections are determined 97% of the time,

17:55.780 --> 17:57.780
especially in the House of Representatives.

17:57.780 --> 18:02.780
They know 97% of the time who's going to get elected before they even get to the ballot

18:02.780 --> 18:06.780
between the gerrymandered districts and the ballot access requirements

18:06.780 --> 18:12.780
whoever wins the R or D that is prominent in that district that they have chosen their voters,

18:12.780 --> 18:15.780
that's who's going to win all the time.

18:15.780 --> 18:17.780
That sounds like a topic for another day.

18:17.780 --> 18:23.780
That's kind of an in-depth interview, but it's interesting to know that, you know.

18:23.780 --> 18:26.780
You know, we have some new tools, Deacon, we have AI.

18:26.780 --> 18:29.780
What do you think about using AI in politics?

18:29.780 --> 18:31.780
Can it be used for good?

18:31.780 --> 18:32.780
Can it be used for evil?

18:32.780 --> 18:33.780
What do you think?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.780
I think like any tool, it can be used either way.

18:36.780 --> 18:41.780
I loved what you were talking about earlier using AI as a way to track representatives and senators

18:41.780 --> 18:43.780
and seeing how they're voting.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.780
I think you should speak more about that.

18:45.780 --> 18:46.780
I think so.

18:46.780 --> 18:51.780
I was talking to Deacon earlier about a platform that I'm building.

18:51.780 --> 18:52.780
I call it, this is us.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.780
You can find it at this is us.org.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.780
This with a hyphen is with a hyphen us.org.

18:58.780 --> 19:05.780
And on that platform, I show folks how you can select your hot button topics.

19:05.780 --> 19:08.780
So when I say a hot button topic, like public land sales.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.780
Right.

19:09.780 --> 19:10.780
When these types...

19:10.780 --> 19:11.780
It was huge in Wyoming.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.780
Huge in Wyoming.

19:12.780 --> 19:16.780
There was a lot of public land and we're really concerned about how that would be sold.

19:16.780 --> 19:22.780
And in the bill that was before Congress, the big beautiful budget bill or whatever we wanted to call it,

19:22.780 --> 19:25.780
it was there and it was hidden in the bill.

19:25.780 --> 19:28.780
But it was, you know, we sussed it out.

19:28.780 --> 19:33.780
But now with the website and the AI tools, we can list them as hot button topics.

19:33.780 --> 19:40.780
So we just ask the AI to check each bill as it comes up for any of the topics that we've listed as our hot button topics.

19:40.780 --> 19:47.780
We want to know about before that legislation goes up for a vote in either the Senate or the House.

19:47.780 --> 19:55.780
And then what this website tool is designed to do is to send back notification to the constituency

19:55.780 --> 20:01.780
and let them decide whether they're in favor of it, whether they're opposed to it,

20:01.780 --> 20:03.780
or whether they need more information.

20:03.780 --> 20:08.780
And that is aggregated back and sent back to the constituency again.

20:08.780 --> 20:12.780
So the constituency knows whether they're...

20:12.780 --> 20:21.780
If you feel strongly about a subject, you should know whether your underwater compared to the rest of the folks in our communities

20:21.780 --> 20:23.780
or you're in the majority.

20:23.780 --> 20:25.780
If you're in the majority, you might be okay with it.

20:25.780 --> 20:30.780
But if you're underwater, you might want to go out and talk to your friends and make sure that they were participating in that discussion.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.780
Because that discussion is important.

20:32.780 --> 20:37.780
So we need to listen to our constituency and we have the tools to bridge.

20:37.780 --> 20:42.780
Now we have the tools to bridge between the representative and the constituency.

20:42.780 --> 20:46.780
And we can get that voice returned back to our constituency if we just...

20:46.780 --> 20:47.780
Where it belongs.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.780
Yeah.

20:48.780 --> 20:52.780
You know, return that voice to the constituency and then the constituency can make their final decision.

20:52.780 --> 20:57.780
And oftentimes, you know what I found at the fair, just talking about a hot button topic like land sales.

20:57.780 --> 21:02.780
I found that if we did that, an interesting thing happens.

21:02.780 --> 21:08.780
People come up with sides on both sides of the issue, floor and against.

21:08.780 --> 21:15.780
For example, I mentioned that we needed to sell a piece of BLM land near Midwest Wyoming.

21:15.780 --> 21:24.780
And we needed to sell a piece of other land near Jackson Hole, a stranger walks up to me here at the fair and says we needed to do that.

21:24.780 --> 21:29.780
So I would be in favor of selling public lands and I'm like, well, to me that's not enough information

21:29.780 --> 21:32.780
because you're not 3% of the public lands was in the bill I believe.

21:32.780 --> 21:34.780
And that's not enough information for me.

21:34.780 --> 21:41.780
I would want to know what exactly you're going to sell, who you're going to sell it to and how you're going to use the money.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.780
And then once I knew that, I could make an informed decision.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.780
But we weren't offered that type of information.

21:46.780 --> 21:51.780
We were just told that this is in the bill and this is what our representatives were going to vote on.

21:51.780 --> 21:58.780
And I honestly believe that, well, I know for a fact that that Luma San Barato voted it out of the Senate initially.

21:58.780 --> 22:00.780
Hagamon returned a yes vote on this.

22:00.780 --> 22:04.780
This very same thing out of the House before it got back to conciliation.

22:04.780 --> 22:10.780
And then during the conciliation process, the senator from Utah that sponsored it with through the legislation.

22:10.780 --> 22:12.780
So it got him off the hook.

22:12.780 --> 22:20.780
But I honestly believe that all three of those of our representatives would have went against the will of the constituency and voted that into law.

22:20.780 --> 22:34.780
And I think that is a horrible type of an idea when we have a hot button topic like that that we don't have a mechanism to return our viewpoint to our constituents when we build that we're being taken advantage of.

22:34.780 --> 22:36.780
And you know what that speaks to?

22:36.780 --> 22:38.780
That speaks to transparency.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.780
And that speaks to accountability.

22:40.780 --> 22:45.780
And that's something that I see as a little we have a little bit of a short coming in in our politics right now.

22:45.780 --> 22:48.780
So we have technology that's available to us.

22:48.780 --> 22:50.780
We all know what a website is.

22:50.780 --> 22:53.780
We are kind of getting familiar with AI right now.

22:53.780 --> 23:01.780
So we have basically real-time tools that we can use to visit with our constituencies as a representative.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.780
And that's what I'm running on on this election cycle.

23:03.780 --> 23:14.780
I've decided to run for Senate to help promote a platform like this to get the conversation started again to regain the conservative values that Wyoming has.

23:14.780 --> 23:19.780
Yeah, I applaud you for getting off the couch and taking that on.

23:19.780 --> 23:34.780
I will say that not only can AI be used for the constituents to know what's in a bill, but after listening to half of the Republicans and half the Democrats saying that they didn't know that that was in the bill, and some of the Republicans saying they wouldn't have voted for it if they would have known it was in the bill.

23:34.780 --> 23:43.780
Help the senators and Republicans or the representatives can use AI to actually proofread a bill and know what's in it before you vote for it.

23:43.780 --> 23:53.780
Well, I guess I'll send a message to my senators and representatives that they can certainly sign up and become a participant in this as us.

23:53.780 --> 23:57.780
And check off the hot button topics that might even be important to them.

23:57.780 --> 24:01.780
So they can have AI get a little message back from AI.

24:01.780 --> 24:03.780
And this is, hey, this is in this bill.

24:03.780 --> 24:05.780
You might want to check it out.

24:05.780 --> 24:08.780
You might want to read what you're signing your name, too.

24:08.780 --> 24:14.780
Yeah, before you put that old rubber stamp down on that piece of paper, go ahead and find out what it actually says.

24:14.780 --> 24:18.780
And this is not a new issue, by the way, for those of you listening.

24:18.780 --> 24:28.780
The Democrats, if you remember back in, I think it was 2018 or somewhere in there, they talked about the fact that they had to pass a bill to know what was in it.

24:28.780 --> 24:30.780
What kind of malarkey is that?

24:30.780 --> 24:32.780
That's a little concerning.

24:32.780 --> 24:34.780
Yeah, a little concerning art.

24:34.780 --> 24:38.780
The folks that we've elected to represent us, not knowing what they're doing.

24:38.780 --> 24:40.780
That's what you're saying?

24:40.780 --> 24:43.780
That's what they stated in their response to voting for legislative.

24:43.780 --> 24:51.780
Because they're getting package of bills that are 1,000 pages, 2,000 pages, which, as a whole, another subject, these bills should not be that inflated.

24:51.780 --> 24:58.780
But they're getting stacks of pages the night before they're supposed to vote on it, and they don't feel like they have enough time to actually read it.

24:58.780 --> 25:01.780
So I'm going to interrupt here for just a second.

25:01.780 --> 25:05.780
And I dislike the use of the word day and there.

25:05.780 --> 25:06.780
Okay.

25:06.780 --> 25:11.780
And the reason being is because when it all boils down to it, it's we, an hour.

25:11.780 --> 25:16.780
We are the people who hold the power in our system of government.

25:16.780 --> 25:19.780
So we need to accept the responsibility.

25:19.780 --> 25:28.780
So when we try to use the pronouns, we, I, they are not necessarily, we unless we're using the royal sense.

25:28.780 --> 25:40.780
When we try to push that off onto another group, we need to accept our little bit of ownership in this because this is our system of government that we're allowing to be manipulated and turned against us.

25:40.780 --> 25:44.780
And, you know, I'm frankly, that's one of the reasons why I'm running for Senate right now.

25:44.780 --> 25:49.780
It's because there's something going on that I, that violates my conservative values.

25:49.780 --> 25:56.780
And that's, that's my voice is being supplanted by, by pundits and news anchors.

25:56.780 --> 25:59.780
And, and I don't know where they all come from.

25:59.780 --> 26:08.780
But there's a, there's, there's a huge community online that talk about, I don't know, reinforcing the, the echo chimped.

26:08.780 --> 26:12.780
I, I guess I'm not, I don't really express this, but what do you think they can?

26:12.780 --> 26:15.780
Well, so to your point, I absolutely agree.

26:15.780 --> 26:19.780
We, we do tend to pass the buck a lot in our conversation.

26:19.780 --> 26:24.780
And even without even realizing it in our language, but we are the fourth branch of government.

26:24.780 --> 26:27.780
We as the citizens, that, that is our responsibility.

26:27.780 --> 26:31.780
When the three branches no longer represent us, it's our job to hold them accountable.

26:31.780 --> 26:37.780
And I think that's what we're seeing a movement of in this country right now is people that are stepping up and coming off the couch and saying,

26:37.780 --> 26:40.780
I can't, I can't watch this happen anymore.

26:40.780 --> 26:45.780
I, I totally agree. I think we each have to own our share of this issue.

26:45.780 --> 26:51.780
And once we accept that inside ourselves and perhaps we can maybe start making a change.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.780
I, I think I, I know we can start making a change.

26:54.780 --> 27:01.780
How complicated it becomes and how many barriers are trying to be thrown up in our way to prevent that change.

27:01.780 --> 27:06.780
That, that's a really, who knows kind of an answer, but I will say this.

27:06.780 --> 27:11.780
The, the three and a half for so years that I spent traveling the country and talking to people.

27:11.780 --> 27:17.780
We all came to a very similar understanding that our real problem is money and politics.

27:17.780 --> 27:26.780
And how the politicians are being paid off by special interest groups, lobbyists, corporations, billionaires, and so forth.

27:26.780 --> 27:33.780
And so that's really where I focus my time is, how do we fix that from the 2010 ruling that happened in the Supreme Court?

27:33.780 --> 27:36.780
Because the average voter doesn't feel like they're being heard.

27:36.780 --> 27:43.780
And so they're kind of taking a step back and just saying, well, if my vote doesn't really matter, then why even participate?

27:43.780 --> 27:45.780
And I think that's the wrong answer.

27:45.780 --> 27:50.780
We have to step forward and say, no, if my vote doesn't matter, how do I make my vote matter?

27:51.780 --> 28:03.780
Right. And, and I think one of the big tools is, is, is our using websites and an AI to, to aggregate our voices into one so that it's harder to ignore us.

28:03.780 --> 28:04.780
Yes.

28:04.780 --> 28:10.780
You know, if you write a letter to your senator, you may get a response, you may get a canned response, or you may get crickets.

28:10.780 --> 28:11.780
Yep.

28:11.780 --> 28:14.780
And when we talk with one voice, it's easy to dismiss us.

28:14.780 --> 28:18.780
But when we talk with the voice of the constituency,

28:18.780 --> 28:20.780
dismiss us at your peril.

28:20.780 --> 28:21.780
Yep.

28:21.780 --> 28:24.780
Because we will let you move on to a new job.

28:24.780 --> 28:25.780
Yep.

28:25.780 --> 28:26.780
And that's the power of us.

28:26.780 --> 28:27.780
Yep.

28:27.780 --> 28:29.780
And this is us.

28:29.780 --> 28:37.780
So I think that I'd like to thank the listeners today, and there's, there's much more information at the website, and I'd like you to get involved.

28:37.780 --> 28:45.780
If you, if you feel strongly about this, I'm looking for, for like-minded individuals to join me on my campaign trail.

28:45.780 --> 28:54.780
I'd like this to have an entire wall of this fair next year, with just candidates that, you know, whether you're Republican or Democrat or independent.

28:54.780 --> 29:08.780
I would like you to stand right here, as long as we're supporting bringing the voice back to the community, and having the communities voice heard in Washington, the state, your county, and your, your local government.

29:08.780 --> 29:15.780
And I'd like to say thank you so very much, Deakin, for coming down to CS, and I look forward to visiting with you again sometime.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.780
Thank you for having me, it was my pleasure.
