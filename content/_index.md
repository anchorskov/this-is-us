🌱 **The Mission**  
We believe in liberty for persons, not just citizens.  
We believe the Constitution is a promise—to everyone under its protection.  
We believe the most patriotic thing you can do… is think.

This is not about partisanship.  
This is about who we are. And who we refuse to become.
