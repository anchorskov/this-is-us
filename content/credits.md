# 🙏 Credits & Transparency

This-Is-Us.org was built through the combined effort of real people and responsible technology.

We believe in transparency—not just in politics, but in how we build the tools that serve our communities.

## 🤖 AI Assistance

Some portions of this site were written, structured, or refined with the assistance of **ChatGPT**, an artificial intelligence tool developed by OpenAI.

ChatGPT was used to:
- Draft and edit content  
- Brainstorm civic engagement features  
- Structure the site’s layout and mission language  
- Offer perspective on inclusive language and tone  

> All decisions, values, and final content reflect human intent and are guided by the principles of integrity, accountability, and civic responsibility.
