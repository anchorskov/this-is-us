# 📣 Open Thank You

To everyone who’s reached out—whether you’ve challenged me, encouraged me, labeled me, or simply watched from the sidelines:  
**Thank you.**  
You’ve helped sharpen my focus.

I’m not here to play a role or please a party.  
I’m here because I believe this moment demands honesty, courage, and conscience.  
That’s how I was raised. That’s how I served. And that’s how I’ll run.  

Here’s where I stand:

---

## 🦏 THE RED RHINO  
### _“Ever try to manipulate a Rhino?”_  
You can’t. We think for ourselves. We stand our ground. We remember who we serve.

---

✅ **TDS?** Check.  
_I break out in truth rashes around cults of personality. I fact-check aggressively—especially those I want to believe._

✅ **Stolen Valor?** Check.  
_Served in the National Guard. Proudly. Honorably._  
_If defending democracy makes me a target, so be it—I’ve worn the uniform._

✅ **Constitutional Oath?** Check.  
_Still binding. Still sacred. Still mine._

✅ **Transparency?** Check.  
_No secrets. No spin. Just straight answers and honest work._

✅ **Accountability?** Check.  
_Congress, do your job. All of it—not just the sound bites._

✅ **No Experience?** Check.  
_I support term limits—and I believe new voices bring new tools._  
_I use technology to gather your views, reflect them back, and explain our position—and why it reflects the will of the constituency—with full transparency. I’ll never stop listening._

✅ **Smartass?** Check.  
_Grandma certified. Humor keeps us grounded, and grounded is where I live._

✅ **Defender of the Voiceless?** Check.  
_I don't shout over people. I stand with them._

✅ **Independent Thinker?** Check.  
_This is America. Greatest Nation on Earth!_

✅ **Wyoming Raised**  
_Born of this land. Tempered by its truth. I understand._

✅ **Wyoming Republican**  
_A real shade of conservatism—measured, grounded, people-first.  
Not tribal. Not angry. Just steady._

## 🟥 BLUF:  
**As the RINO at the table, I’m ALL IN.**  
Go ahead—**call my BLUF.**

I don’t bluff about the Constitution.  
I don’t bluff about truth.  
I don’t bluff about integrity.  
And I sure as hell don’t fold for a con.

**Go then—and wake those sleeping.**

**With respect,**

*For Congress 2026*  
**Republican for Wyoming**
