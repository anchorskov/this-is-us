## Why We Exist

I am afraid. Not for myself. I am afraid for my children—and for my grandchildren.

What rights are we abdicating? What legacy are we giving up?

I speak a little Spanish. If forced, I may survive in El Salvador. But our children, our grandchildren? Why should we even have to be concerned about their future that our legacy is building. We wouldn’t stand for any threats to children, yet we watch as our democracy is eroded. It’s not just borders or passports that worry me—it’s the decay of something deeper: our shared understanding of freedom, truth, and decency.

I’ve accepted that some of you may have already made up your minds. That you may never even attempt to read this. And that’s exactly how insidious this battle has become.

This isn’t just a political fight. This is a war for our minds.
And frankly—we are losing.

> “The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.” —Plutarch  
> “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” —John 8:32  
> “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.” —Edmund Burke

Yes, it may already be too late.  
But if you’ve read this far… maybe—just maybe—there is hope.

**This Is US**, this movement, was conceived in an effort to understand what is happening in America—why so many good, honest citizens, who have looked out for their neighbors and defended freedom around the world, would suddenly stop, bend, and accept lies, mistruths, and nonsense.

I began this journey *first to understand,* and now, to be understood. My understanding may not be perfect—but here it is.

Let’s work through this together.

## Our Approach

The mind is like a strong tree—it needs light, truth, and space to grow. Like a tree, truth grows slowly—but it outlasts the storm.

As human beings:
- We are wired for survival.
- We react when threatened.
- We conform to our group.
- We are stronger together.
- And we always return to truth.

Fear is a powerful tool used by abusers to manipulate and control their victims.  
Abusers deliberately use fear to control, manipulate, and silence their victims.

We believe the path forward lies in thinking clearly, critically, and courageously.

## Our Foundation: Critical Thinking in Perilous Times

**Shield your mind with these five tools:**

1. **Ask: What are the facts?**  
   Don’t accept headlines or hearsay. Look for original sources, full quotes, and context. If a claim seems designed to make you angry or afraid, slow down and dig deeper.

2. **Separate emotion from evidence.**  
   Feeling strongly doesn’t make something true. Ask: Am I reacting emotionally, or reasoning clearly? Emotions are valid—but facts don’t care how we feel.

3. **Consider the source.**  
   Who benefits if you believe this? Is the source reliable, transparent, or biased? Always check: Who’s saying this—and why?

4. **Be willing to change your mind.**  
   Strong thinkers revise their opinions when presented with new evidence. That’s not weakness—it’s growth. Certainty without curiosity leads to regret.

5. **Look for patterns—not just points.**  
   A single incident can mislead. Patterns reveal truth. Ask: Is this an isolated case or part of a bigger trend?

## What We Oppose
- Authoritarianism disguised as freedom  
- Billionaire control of public discourse  
- Disinformation, division, and distraction

## What We Support
- Local voices and lived experiences  
- Civil discourse and civic literacy  
- Courageous truth-telling—rooted in fact, compassion, and law

We have not forgotten our reasons for existing—our passions, our legacy. And we won’t stand by while they’re rewritten by fear, apathy, or deceit.

**This Is US**, this movement, is a space for anyone ready to think critically, tell their story, and defend what’s worth saving.

## Our Call to Action

Together—with truth, integrity, and compassion—we can reestablish transparency and accountability in our democracy.

Democracy is messy. It takes time. But we are failing ourselves when we allow half-truths, tribalism, and manipulated narratives to bend our thinking.

We are under attack—and many don’t even realize it. Your mind is under attack. Who is manipulating your instincts? Ask why.

But we can do something about it. We can unite—and when we do, we are stronger. We can choose dialogue over division, clarity over confusion, and courage over comfort.

We will survive. We are wired for it. And if we must fight, let it be for opportunity and freedom—not fear. Not just for me but also for my neighbor—we are stronger together.

> We are threatened. Our democracy is threatened. The rule of law is threatened.

So conform—yes—but not to propaganda. Conform to truth. Join the group that supports reason, compassion, and the Constitution. Align with the side that defends liberty for all, not power for the few.

Because in the end, we always return to truth.  
Change is the only constant—and history records the truth.  
The lies? They’re just footnotes.

**Join us. Think. Speak. Act. Defend.**

**This is US.**
